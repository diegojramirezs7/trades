## Tradepros Flutter Sample

- To run this project, Flutter needs needs to be installed on the machine and have some available devices to run the application. 
- A virtual device can be used with Android studio.

## Running

Get the code by running command: 
```shell
git clone https://github.com/diegojramirezs7/trades.git
```
or by downloading the zip and unpacking it. 


Inside the trades folder created, run command:
```shell
flutter run
```

or 
```shell
flutter run -d <device name>
```

- The app can also run on Chrome by enabling web.
```shell
 flutter channel beta
 flutter upgrade
 flutter config --enable-web

 flutter run -d Chrome
```

## Notes
I couldn't test the iOS version since I couldn't install XCode and all the related tools on my computer. 
After spending more than a day trying to free up storage space to get Xcode and trying differerent ways of installing it, I decided to only test the code on the Android simulator, my Android phone and on Chrome. 
To install XCode, I'll need to spend a little more time cleaning up my computer to have the sufficient storage space.
